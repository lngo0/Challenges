public class HurdleRace {
    /*
        There is a magic potion they can take that will increase their maximum jump height by 1 unit for each dose.
        How many doses of the potion must the character take to be able to jump all of the hurdles.
        If the character can already clear all of the hurdles, return 0.

        Example
            height = [1,2,3,3,2]
            k = 1
        The character can jump 1 unit high initially and must take 3-1 = 2 doses of potion to be able to jump all of the hurdles.

        Function Description
            Complete the hurdleRace function in the editor below.
            hurdleRace has the following parameter(s):
            int k: the height the character can jump naturally
            int height[n]: the heights of each hurdle
        Returns
            int: the minimum number of doses required, always 0 or more
        Input Format
            The first line contains two space-separated integers n and k, the number of hurdles and the maximum height the character can jump naturally.
            The second line contains  space-separated integers  where .
        Constraints
            1 <= n,k <= 100
            1 <= height[i] <= 100

        Sample Input 0
            5 4
            1 6 3 5 2
        Sample Output 0
            2
        Explanation 0
            Dan's character can jump a maximum of k = 4 units, but the tallest hurdle has a height of h1 = 6:
            To be able to jump all the hurdles, Dan must drink 6-4 = 2 doses.

        Sample Input 1
            5 7
            2 5 4 5 2
        Sample Output 1
            0
        Explanation 1
            Dan's character can jump a maximum of 7 units, which is enough to cross all the hurdles:
            Because he can already jump all the hurdles, Dan needs to drink 0 doses.
